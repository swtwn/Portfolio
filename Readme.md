__ROBLOX WORK PORTOFOLIO__

**Intro**
* Hello, I am swtwn, I am a scripter and I specialize in some programming languages. I have worked at numerous front-page games such as aut, riu, some one piece games and some other anime games. My timing is GMT + 7.

**SkillSet**
* I have been scripting on the ROBLOX platform for almost 4-7 years now. I can code in any style you prefer such as object-orienting programming (OOP), Module/Functions programming etc. I know both back-end and front-end scripting. I can code anything you want me to and in any style u want me to code it in. If you don't know anything about scripting, no worries, my scripting style is very easy to understand and very clean. I can work both as a team player or solo.
* NOTE: i won't script anything that i know is going to take alot of time unless the payment is worth it.

* Including:
  * • DataStores.
  * • Shops/NPCs.
  * • UIs.
  * • Complete Back-Ends.
  * • Complete Front-Ends.
  * • Your Own Frameworks.
