** Intro **
* Hello, I am swtwn, I am a scripter and I specialize in some programming languages. I have worked at numerous front-page games such as aut, riu, some one piece games and some other anime games. My timing is GMT + 7.

# SkillSet
* I have been scripting on the ROBLOX platform for almost 6-7 years now. I can code in any style you prefer such as object-orienting programming (OOP), Module/Functions programming etc. I know both back-end and front-end scripting. I can code anything you want me to and in any style u want me to code it in. If you don't know anything about scripting, no worries, my scripting style is very easy to understand and very clean. I can work both as a team player or solo.
* NOTE: i won't script anything that i know is going to take alot of time unless the payment is worth it.

# PAST WORK
* Soon to be added.

# Availability
* i am mostly available all day. but if you message me and i don't reply, please wait a bit since i am either sleeping or busy at some other project.
